// Description:
//     I would like to be able to pass an array with two elements to my swapValues function to swap the values. However it appears that the values aren't changing.
//
// Can you figure out what's wrong here?

//SOLUTION


function swapValues(arr) {


    let a =[arr[0], arr[1]] = [arr[1], arr[0]]
    return a
}
