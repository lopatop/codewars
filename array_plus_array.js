// DESCRIPTION:
// I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.
// P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

// SOLUTION:

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
    let sumArr1 = 0;
    let sumArr2 = 0;
    let sumArr; 
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++){
    sumArr1 += arr1[i];
  }
    for (let i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++){
    sumArr2 += arr2[i];
  }
    sumArr = sumArr1 + sumArr2; 
    return sumArr;
  }
