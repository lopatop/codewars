// Description:
//     You are given two strings. In a single move, you can choose any of them, and delete the first (i.e. leftmost) character.
//
//     For Example:
//
//     By applying a move to the string "where", the result is the string "here".
//     By applying a move to the string "a", the result is an empty string "".
//     Implement a function that calculates the minimum number of moves that should be performed to make the given strings equal.
//
//     Notes
// Both strings consist of lowercase latin letters.
//     If the string is already empty, you cannot perform any more delete operations.

// SOLUTION:

function shiftLeft(s, t) {
    let i = s.length - 1;
    let j = t.length - 1;
    let common = 0;

    while (i >= 0 && j >= 0 && s[i] === t[j]) {
        common++;
        i--;
        j--;
    }

    return (s.length - common) + (t.length - common);
}
